# react-router-partial-app-loading
Partial app loading using react-router and webpack 2 ðŸŽ‰

This is the fork of the official react-router [huge-apps example](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/examples/huge-apps),
but uses Webpack 2 and `import()` API in stead of Webpack 1 and `require.ensure()`

# Usage
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/notgiorgi/react-router.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
